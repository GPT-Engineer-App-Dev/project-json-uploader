# project-json-uploader

Please implement a web app with the following features:

1. A file input that allows uploading a JSON file 
2. After uploading, parse the JSON and extract the "data" object
3. Display a list of project IDs extracted from the keys of the "data" object
4. When a project ID is selected from the list, display all the edits for that project
5. The edit list should show each edit's creation time, prompt, and status
6. Order the edits by creation time, with most recent first
7. Include a button to clear the currently loaded data

For the UI, use a clean and simple layout with a sidebar for the project list and main content area for the edit list. Let me know if you have any other questions!
